1: Challenge your Mental Models
Acknowledge and challenge the assumptions that guide today’s thinking.

# Background Information
You’ve heard of thinking outside of the box; at BCG, we apply doubt to the box itself. We challenge our assumptions and constraints; we ask ourselves why something has to be a certain way, and we ask what would happen under different sets of paradigms. Doing so provides BCGers and our clients with the freedom to find creative solutions to problems.

In this task, you will learn about shifting mental models and get the chance to practice this skill. You will start this task by completing some learning on the topic, similar to how our strategy consultants begin a project. 

You’ll watch a TED Talk from BCG Partner & Director Alan Iny, (“Alan Iny: Reigniting Creativity in Business” linked below), which provides a great overview into how BCG thinks about creativity and the key role played by doubt. You will then read an article titled “Breaking Through: Proven Idea-Generation Practices" also linked below that discusses some idea-generation best practices from the BCG website. These two resources will provide a good baseline for you to move on to the “Paradigm-Busting Workbook” that you will need to complete in this task.

You will be asked to look through a couple of topics that others may typically see as threats and reframe them as opportunities. Pushing yourself to challenge assumptions and quickly reframe them is one of the most important ingredients to thinking creatively as a strategy consultant. You will then learn about a few examples of dramatic shifts in mental models that have changed companies or industries for the better.
