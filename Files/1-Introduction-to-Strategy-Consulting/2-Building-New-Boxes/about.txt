2: Building New Boxes
Reframe questions, doubt assumptions and build a new reference point to set up a valuable brainstorming session.

# Background Information
Decades of BCG research and experience have gone into putting together a powerful model for effective brainstorming. We do not want our clients to spend valuable time in anything-goes brainstorming sessions, which only drive far-out thinking that doesn’t actually lead to meaningful insight and, ultimately, meaningful change.

You are going to generate ideas to help a fictional luxury clothing company increase sales revenue. Instead of just diving into a brainstorming session, this task will explain some of the important steps that help BCGers work with clients to generate impactful ideas. You will learn about framing effective questions, creating conditions that aid creativity, revealing and doubting your current assumptions (or “boxes”), building new ones, and generating ideas within those new boxes.

Think of these new boxes like a kite and its string. Far from stopping a kite from flying away, the string actually keeps the kite flying. If you cut the string, the kite doesn’t fly away; it actually falls to the earth. Similarly, building new boxes to ideate within doesn’t inhibit creativity, but facilitates it. The key is to build the right boxes to ideate within.
